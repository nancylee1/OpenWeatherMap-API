# :cloud::sun_with_face:    Open Weather Map - API & JSon :thermometer:

<h2> Find out your current weather forecast! </h2>

I created a Microsoft .Net 6.0 comsole application that calls the OpenWeatherMap API to check the current weather forecast by entering any zipcode! Here are the steps I took below to make this weather 
application happen: 

<ul>
<li>I created an OpenWeatherMap account to get a free API Key</li>
<li>Add the NewtonSoft.Json Nuget Package to my Console App</li>
<li>Used C# to convert the CURRENT weather for the City you specify in degrees fahrenheit as the API provided Kelvin</li>
<li>Creatively displayed & organized the response</li>

An example of the current weather API response is below:

Using the code below:
